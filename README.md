## 🚀 How to Run Locally

This is a static website, so it requires no backend server setup.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vybe-africa-website.git
    ```
2.  **Open the Project**:
    Navigate to the folder and simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
3.  **Local Server (Optional but Recommended)**:
    For the best experience (especially for loading local assets properly), run a simple local server:
    ```bash
    # using Python
    python3 -m http.server
    # Then visit http://localhost:8000
    ```

## 🖌️ Customization Guide

### Changing Colors
All colors are managed in `css/styles.css` under the `:root` variables:
```css
:root {
    --primary-brand: #ff0055; /* Change this for main accent */
    --secondary-brand: #7000ff; /* Secondary accent */
    --background-dark: #050505; /* Main background */
}
```

### Updating Stats
Edit the `data-target` attributes in `index.html` to change the final numbers:
```html
<div class="stat-number" data-target="5000">0</div>
```

### Adding Gallery Images
In `gallery.html`, simply duplicate a `.masonry-item` block and update the `src` attribute.
